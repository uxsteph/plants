                             <p id="moreinfo2">when i first met lauren he was terribly unhappy. he lived outside on the balcony/fire-escape and he was brown. not the happy kind of poc brown (though poc are often sad, too), but the dwindling plant kind of brown. basically, he was on the verge of death. the balcony of death. my boyfriend thought the downstairs neighbor's smoking habit was the cause of it, and probably also the sun? maybe? idk, lauren is an aloe plant so the sun should be good for him, but, anyway. my boyfriend brought lauren inside, cut off all his dead parts until he was one singular stalk. and then... he was revived! bright green and growing, it was a literal rising from the ashes (soil) moment. now, lauren is glorious. you go, lauren!</p>
